; --- Specific flags for ESP32-C3 Super Mini ---
; These enable USB CDC (Serial over USB) on boot, which is essential for the Super Mini
; as it often uses the native USB for serial communication rather than an external UART chip.
build_flags =
    -DARDUINO_USB_MODE=1
    -DARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1


; --- Optional: For specific Super Mini variants or if LED_BUILTIN isn't working ---
; If your Super Mini's onboard LED is on GPIO8 (common), you can define it here.
; If you have issues, you can also define it directly in your code (e.g., #define LED_BUILTIN 8).
; build_unflags = -DLED_BUILTIN ; Uncomment to remove default LED_BUILTIN
; build_flags = ${env.build_flags} -DLED_BUILTIN=8
